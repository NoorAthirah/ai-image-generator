🧠 How It Works
User enters a prompt or uses the random prompt feature.

JavaScript sends a request to the Hugging Face API with the prompt.

The API returns an image, which is dynamically added to the gallery.

The theme can be toggled between dark and light modes.

The layout adjusts seamlessly for all screen sizes.
